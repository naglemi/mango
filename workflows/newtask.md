description: Switch to a new task in a forked conversation while retaining context
---

New task. I have forked and cloned this chat. I am leaving context for previous tasks here for general context, but do not resume previous tasks. Those are being handled by the other clone. You may not be able to see the most recent, still-running action being taken by the other clone with the same context window. Don't worry about that. Just follow the new instructions I am about to give you. Disregard previous instructions insofar as what you are actually instructed to do, but note them for general context and background. You have a new task now.
